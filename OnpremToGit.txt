Create a GitHub Repository:
---------------------------------

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one at https://github.com/.
Once you have an account, log in and click the "+" sign in the upper right corner to create a new repository.
Follow the instructions to create a new repository, and make it public or private as per your needs.
Initialize a Git Repository Locally:

On your local machine, navigate to the root directory of your on-premises application's code.
Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
Run the following commands to initialize a Git repository and make an initial commit:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Link Your Local Repository to GitHub:

On your GitHub repository's page, you'll see an option to "Push an existing repository from the command line." Follow the instructions there. It will look something like this:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Push Your Code to GitHub:

Run the following command to push your code to the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Now, your on-premises application's code should be on GitHub.

Additional Tips:

Make sure to configure your Git credentials if you haven't already, as GitHub will require authentication.
Consider adding a .gitignore file to your repository to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.
Keep your GitHub repository up to date by regularly pushing changes.
